Homework Assignment 3:  Justin and Rahel: team effort

The simple example we built attempts to create a relational system
of subject actions and objects, where certain senses can only

we create a thousand random instances of subjects and objects and
attempt to determine how many possible ways we can match subjects to 
objects.

We do this to test the parallel processing potential in Ruby as well.
